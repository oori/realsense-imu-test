# CSV recordings notes
 - There's always little trash at start and end of each file
 - Each step is 60cm (`2B`) or 30cm (`1B`).
 - Same path always. 1B have 18 steps, 2B have 9.
 - Starting foot is RIGHT. Filenames with `L` suffix (*eg. 30L.csv*) means starting with LEFT foot.

# Recorded gait sequence

 2. 9/18 steps
 3. full stop
 4. 180 turn
 5. full stop
 6. 9/18 steps
 7. full stop.
 8. *(trash ~0.5s)* turn toward laptop to stop check recording
